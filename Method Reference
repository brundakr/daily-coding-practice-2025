Method reference (::)

It is just a shorter way of writing a lambda.

Rule:
A::b means → “call method b on object A”

This means:
“take x, call getDepartment() on it”

Employee::getDepartment


----------

evenList.forEach(System.out::println);

forEach() needs something that:
takes one item and does something with it

x -> System.out.println(x)
Which means: “Pass x into println(x)”

Same as: System.out::println
