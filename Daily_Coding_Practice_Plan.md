## **EMERGENCY HELP GUIDE**

### **If You Get Stuck:**
1. **Re-read the problem** - Often the solution is in the details
2. **Break it down** - Split complex problems into smaller parts
3. **Use debugging** - Add print statements to understand flow
4. **Check logs** - Error messages contain valuable information
5. **Only then search** - Use specific error messages, not generic queries

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**
- **NullPointerException:** Check for null values before using objects
- **404 Errors:** Verify URL mappings and controller paths
- **Database Errors:** Check connection strings and entity mappings
- **CORS Issues:** Configure proper CORS settings in Spring Boot
- **Component Not Found:** Verify imports and module declarations
